This project contains libraries to play "Domin√≥ de tren mexicano" vs. human or AI players.

The rules for the game can be found (in Spanish) here: https://www.juegosdilemma.com/instrucciones-domino-tren-mexicano/

However, it is important to note that there are a plethora of house rules and variations. This project is currently tuned to play with the rules I play at home.
To be honest, I created all of this out of spite just to beat my mom who always seems to win.
